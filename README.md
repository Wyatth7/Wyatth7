# Hey, Fellas

If you haven't already guessed it, I'm a fullstack web developer who mostly uses Javascript and its surrounding frameworks. Luckily for you though, almost all of my repositories are fully open source, so, if you find a project that interests you, check it out! And, if you find a bug in the code, just open an issue. 



<!---
Wyatth7/Wyatth7 is a ✨ special ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
You can click the Preview link to take a look at your changes.
